# Xplore

A bilingual game‑completion **checklist** tracker. Browse a shared catalog of games,
add them to your library, and tick off everything worth doing — grouped into
chapters/phases with optional per‑item tips (e.g. boss strategies, item locations).

Live: **https://xplore-delta.vercel.app**

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack) + **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** + **shadcn** (Base UI variant), **lucide-react** icons, **Geist** font
- **Supabase** — Postgres + Auth, SSR cookie sessions via `@supabase/ssr`
- **PWA** — web app manifest + service worker
- Hosted on **Vercel** (auto‑deploy on push to `main`)

> ⚠️ This repo pins a modified Next.js 16 where "middleware" is renamed **`proxy.ts`** and
> other conventions differ from older Next.js. See `AGENTS.md` — read the guides in
> `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before changing framework‑level code.

## Features

- **Auth**: email/password sign‑up (email confirmation), login/logout, password
  recovery, and self‑service account deletion.
- **Profiles**: auto‑created on sign‑up; editable display name + avatar on `/account`.
- **Catalog & library**: all authenticated users see the shared catalog; each user adds
  games to their own library and tracks their own progress.
- **Checklists**: game → categories (chapters) → items (title + optional description).
  A **tabbed navigator** shows one chapter at a time — a lateral index on desktop,
  horizontal tabs on mobile — with the active section persisted in the URL (`?c=<id>`)
  so a refresh returns to the same place.
- **Ownership**: only a game's creator can edit its checklist (enforced by RLS + UI).
- **Bilingual (EN default / PT)**: the whole UI and all game content are localizable.
- **Theming**: dark by default, with a light‑mode toggle (no flash on load).
- **Covers**: game cover art rendered on cards and the detail page.
- **Keepalive cron**: a daily Vercel Cron pings the DB so the Supabase free tier
  doesn't auto‑pause.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Scripts: `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`.

### Environment variables (`.env.local`)

| Variable | Scope | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | public | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | public | Supabase anon/publishable key |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | **server only** | Service‑role key (admin client) |
| `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` | server only | DB password for CLI migrations |
| `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` | server only | Supabase project ref |
| `CRON_SECRET` | **server only** | Bearer token that guards `/api/cron/keepalive` |

The same variables are configured in Vercel (Production + Development). Never expose
`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` or `CRON_SECRET` to the client.

## Routes

| Path | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` | Auth (public) |
| `/auth/confirm`, `/auth/callback` | Email‑link handlers (set session cookies) |
| `/dashboard` | The signed‑in user's library |
| `/games`, `/games/new` | Catalog + create a game |
| `/games/[slug]`, `/games/[slug]/edit` | Game detail (checklist) + owner‑only editor |
| `/account` | Profile + danger zone (delete account) |
| `/api/cron/keepalive` | `GET`, Bearer‑authed; runs daily via `vercel.json` cron |
| `proxy.ts` (root) | Auth gating (Next 16's renamed middleware) |

## Data model

Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/` (applied with the Supabase CLI:
`supabase db push --linked`).

- `games` — `id, slug, title, title_i18n, platform, cover_url, created_by`
- `checklist_categories` — `id, game_id, title, title_i18n, order_index`
- `checklist_items` — `id, category_id, title, title_i18n, description, description_i18n, order_index`
- `user_game_progress` — `(user_id, game_id)` = a game in a user's library
- `user_item_progress` — `(user_id, item_id, completed, completed_at)`
- `profiles` — `id, display_name, avatar_url` (auto‑created by an `auth.users` insert trigger)

**RLS**: the catalog (`games`, `checklist_categories`, `checklist_items`) is readable by any
authenticated user but writable only by a game's `created_by`; `user_*_progress` and
`profiles` rows are scoped to their owner.

The `*_i18n` columns are JSONB locale maps like `{ "en": "…", "pt": "…" }`. The plain
`title`/`description` columns hold the fallback value (see i18n below).

## Internationalization (`src/i18n/`)

- **Default locale** is English; a `locale` cookie switches to Portuguese. It's a cookie
  (not `localStorage`) so Server Components can read it and render the right language.
- `config.ts` — `locales`, `defaultLocale`, cookie name. `get-locale.ts` reads/validates it.
- `dictionaries/en.ts` is the **source of truth** for the `Dictionary` type; `pt.ts` must
  match its shape. `get-dictionary.ts` maps locale → dictionary and exposes `t()` for
  `{placeholder}` interpolation.
- **UI strings** come from the dictionary. Server pages call `getLocale()` + `getDictionary()`
  and pass strings to client components as props (clients can't call the server helpers).
- **Content** (game/category/item text) is stored bilingually and resolved with
  `pick(row.title_i18n, locale, row.title)`. Official content is fully bilingual;
  user‑created content is single‑language with fallback to whatever exists.
- `LocaleToggle` (header) sets the cookie and calls `router.refresh()`.

## Adding official game content

Curated games (e.g. Metal Gear Solid) live as `content/games/<slug>.json` — full bilingual
`title_i18n`/`description_i18n` for the game, its categories, and its items, each carrying a
stable, frozen `key`. Covers go in `public/covers/<slug>.png`, referenced via `cover_url`.

Sync a file to the database with `scripts/games/sync.mjs` (service role, bypasses RLS):

```
npm run games:import -- <slug> --dry-run   # preview
npm run games:import -- <slug>             # apply
```

The importer upserts by `(parent, key)`, so ids — and therefore everyone's saved progress —
survive re-imports; it also looks up HowLongToBeat completion times once per game and caches
them into the same file. `npm run games:export -- <slug>` bootstraps a new file from an
existing DB row. See `AGENTS.md` for the full contract (flags, orphan handling, HLTB caching).

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers a Vercel production deploy. The `dev` branch is kept in sync
and produces preview deploys. Database migrations are applied separately via the Supabase
CLI against the linked project.
